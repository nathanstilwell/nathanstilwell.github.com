Life is full of chapters and mine is no different.

I am on page one of a brand new chapter of my life. One that comes after leaving the best job I've ever had. Which is probably why I stayed longer than I've ever stayed in any other job for my entire life. In America, jobs are like bones that connect your life together. This may speak to our over emphasis on work. We spend more time at our job than we do at anything else (probably). We introduce ourselves with our profession or what we *do for a living*.
