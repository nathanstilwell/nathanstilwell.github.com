# What is this folder?

I thought about having a blog for a minute, but then it didn't happen. I removed
the `_posts` folder and the `blog.html`, but kept this image
[Elizabeth](http://elizabethstilwell.com/) drew for me. I still love it and kind
of want to do something with it in the future. So it's here for if I ever think
of anything for it.
